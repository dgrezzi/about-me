                        Sussex, England. Graduated in Chemistry, I have always had a
                        strong interest in programming. During college, I had the
                        opportunity to develop laboratory analysis equipment
                        programmed with Arduino microcontroller. For 10 years, I
                        worked as an analytical chemist in laboratories for large
                        pharmaceutical multinationals. Seeking new challenges, I
                        decided to delve into the world of programming and learn new
                        languages.

                        Currently, I am focused on learning web and mobile systems
                        development, which allows me to expand my knowledge and
                        skills in programming and apply them to challenging
                        projects. I am always seeking new opportunities to grow and
                        learn as a developer, while continuing to expand my career
                        in the world of technology."
