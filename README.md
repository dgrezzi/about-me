# about-me

"My name is Daniel and I'm a Brazilian living in West Sussex, England. Graduated in Chemistry, I have always had a strong interest in programming. During college, I had the opportunity to develop laboratory analysis equipment programmed with Arduino microcontroller. For 10 years, I worked as an analytical chemist in laboratories for large pharmaceutical multinationals. Seeking new challenges, I decided to delve into the world of programming and learn new languages.

Currently, I am focused on learning web and mobile systems development, which allows me to expand my knowledge and skills in programming and apply them to challenging projects. I am always seeking new opportunities to grow and learn as a developer, while continuing to expand my career in the world of technology."
